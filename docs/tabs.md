# Terminal Tabs

Alacritty supports terminal tabs on macOS and Linux, allowing you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.

## macOS Tabs

On macOS, Alacritty uses the native tabbing functionality provided by the operating system. Tabs can be created and managed using the following keyboard shortcuts:

- `Cmd+T` - Create a new tab
- `Cmd+Shift+]` or `Cmd+Tab` - Switch to the next tab
- `Cmd+Shift+[` or `Cmd+Shift+Tab` - Switch to the previous tab
- `Cmd+1` through `Cmd+8` - Switch to a specific tab (1-8)
- `Cmd+9` - Switch to the last tab

## Linux Tabs

On Linux, Alacritty implements pseudo-tabs by creating new windows that are visually grouped together. The following keyboard shortcuts are available:

- `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Create a new tab (new window)
- `Ctrl+Shift+]` - Switch to the next tab
- `Ctrl+Shift+[` - Switch to the previous tab
- `Alt+1` through `Alt+8` - Switch to a specific tab (1-8)
- `Alt+9` - Switch to the last tab

Note that on Linux, tabs are implemented as separate windows, so they may not have the same visual integration as macOS tabs.
